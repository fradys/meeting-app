# meeting-app
A school project based on PHP and AJAX

This was the PHP project to Advanced Web Programming Class in my school, it was the first PHP project that I ever done.

This simple App uses PHP, JavaScript, JASON, AJAX and MySQL techniques. 
The idea is to create an App that would allowed a company to create meetings, it is possible to type subject, description, select participants, a conference room and  date/time. The right side of the page shows the next meetings based on today's date and it's visible for the entire application.

It is also possible to add and edit participants, branch (building), conference room and equipments.

This project was created from scratch using simple HTML, and all the forms are updated using AJAX / JSON, and the integration between form data and database was using PHP.
